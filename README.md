# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Vehicles.
Overview:
The automobile maintenance paradigm is shifting from traditional reactive and scheduled servicing toward Predictive Maintenance (PDM), enabled by the integration of Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). This project demonstrates how real-time sensor data and advanced ML algorithms can be leveraged to predict and prevent vehicle component failures before they occur.

🔍 Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a scalable, real-time vehicle health monitoring system that:
Detects early signs of component failure.
Reduces unplanned downtimes.
Enhances road safety.
Optimizes maintenance schedules.

🛠️ Technologies Used: 
IoT Hardware: Real-time sensors embedded in vehicle subsystems (engine, brakes, tires, etc.)
Microcontroller: ESP32 for data collection and processing

Machine Learning Algorithms: 
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
MLP Neural Networks
Python for data preprocessing and model development

📊 Dataset and Features: 
A custom-built dataset was created containing key vehicle health indicators such as:
Engine Temperature
Oil Pressure
Battery Voltage
Tire Pressure
Brake Wear Levels
Vehicle Mileage

Data Processing: 
Preprocessing and feature engineering were applied to clean and standardize sensor data.
Supervised learning models were trained on this dataset to predict failure likelihoods.

🧠 Model Evaluation: 
Models were evaluated using the following metrics:
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
ROC Curves
Gradient Boosting achieved accuracy > 86%, with Neural Networks showing the highest performance and robustness.

📡 Real-Time Deployment: 
The best-performing models were deployed in real-time on vehicles equipped with:
ESP32 microcontrollers
A suite of IoT sensors
A notification system for immediate driver and fleet manager alerts
This allows vehicles to become self-monitoring systems, capable of dynamically diagnosing and alerting for potential issues, reducing breakdowns and improving safety.

💡 Unique Contributions: 
Seamless integration of low-cost hardware with intelligent software
Scalable and cost-effective design suitable for both fleets and individual vehicles
Versatility across vehicle types and adaptability to evolving data patterns

🔭 Future Enhancements: 
The project lays the groundwork for more advanced predictive maintenance solutions, including:
